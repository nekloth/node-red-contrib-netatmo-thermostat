This is a quick to-do list for this project.

# New nodes
According to the Netatmo documentation, there are 5 different endpoints. Potientially each of them can be "node-redified":

[ ] Create new schedule
[x] Get thermostats data
[x] Setthermpoint
[ ] Switch schedule
[ ] Syncschedule

# Setthermpoint
[ ] Include a dropdown list to select the mode
[ ] Improve device_id/module_id input (if possible)
